# Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my portfolio of machine learning projects. In this repository, you will find a collection of projects I completed during my machine learning course. Each project demonstrates a variety of machine learning techniques, datasets, and problem-solving skills. Below, you can find a brief overview of each project.

This is the result of Machine learning course presented in the University of Tehran.
